# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the company) using historical customer data.
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Churn Modelling Dataset)
- Rows: 10,000
- Target variable: Exited (1 = churn, 0 = not churn)

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Random Forest (improved model)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~87%
- Model performs well on non-churn customers and reasonably on churn customers

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
